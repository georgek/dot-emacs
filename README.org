#+TITLE: My Emacs configuration

My config is now based on [[https://github.com/emacscollective/emacs.g][emacs.g]] and uses [[https://github.com/emacscollective/borg][borg]].

I always target the latest version of Emacs.

* Usage

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
  git clone <this> ~/.emacs.d
  cd ~/.emacs.d/
  make bootstrap-borg
  make bootstrap
#+END_SRC

Note that the bootstrap process by default will attempt to connect to Github,
Gitlab and code.orgmode.org via SSH. If you don't have SSH keys set up for any
of these (and don't want to set them up) then do the following before doing
~make bootstrap-borg~:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
  git config --global url.https://github.com/.insteadOf git@github.com:
  git config --global url.https://gitlab.com/.insteadOf git@gitlab.com:
  git config --global url.https://code.orgmode.org/.insteadOf git@code.orgmode.org:
#+END_SRC

** Tree-Sitter

Since tree-sitter grammars are platform dependent, they might need to be rebuilt with
~M-x treesit-install-language-grammar~.

** Fonts

The config uses nerd fonts.  I keep a copy of them in my [[https://github.com/georgek/dotfiles][dotfiles]].
